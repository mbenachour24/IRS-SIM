# 🌀 IRS-Institutional Recursive Simulator (OPTIMUS Engine)

> A recursive simulation of institutional evolution and structural coupling — blending algorithmic normativity with computational epistemology.

## 📘 Overview

**IRS-Institutional Recursive Simulator** (`IRS-sim.py`) is a compact simulation engine that models the evolution of institutions as recursively structured agents. It operationalizes theoretical frameworks from systems theory, algorithmic jurisprudence, and computational philosophy.

This repository grounds the implementation of the **OPTIMUS** research logic, simulating a multi-agent institutional system over recursive cycles. Its goal is to demonstrate how cognition, legality, and social coherence can emerge from recursive inter-agent feedback loops, not from predefined axioms.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundation
- **Recursive Modulation Rule**: `Sⁿ⁺¹ = K ⋅ C(f(Sⁿ), g(Sⁿ))`
- **Agents** are functionally differentiated:
  - `f` (Consultants): decision proposers
  - `g` (Experts): validators of institutional logic
  - `h` (HR): governance controller
- **Output S(t)** models the system state across time
- Tracks emergence of **S\***, a computational attractor that gives information about the stability of the system

## 🔧 Files & Structure
```
.
├── irscap.py           # Core simulation file
├── requirements.txt    # Required dependencies (e.g. matplotlib, numpy, names)
```

## 🚀 Quickstart
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the simulation**:
   ```bash
   python IRS-sim.py
   ```

3. Outputs (auto-generated):
   - `consultant_log.csv`
   - `irs_calculations.log`
   - `visualizations/*.png`
   - `reports/*.csv` + `*.md`

## 📈 What it Simulates
- Recursive generation and validation of decisions
- Institutional memory and historical performance metrics
- Structural coupling between agents
- Emergence of profit, governance stability, and recursive norms

## 🚜 Future Work
- Integrate external norm generation via a decentralized network
- Add cross-agent negotiation mechanisms
- Explore convergence to S\* under varying institutional perturbations
